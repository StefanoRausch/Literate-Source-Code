# Literate Source Code

**Explain and Code.**

To document single source code units ( files ) can be a daunting task — at least it has been for me. On the one hand there are well established ( strict ) standards following for example the DocBlock Guidelines [^DocBlock] and on the other side of the spectrum there is no [software documentation][] at all — the latter not being the choice of the day.

The question to be answered is what, how ( much ) and to whom exactly a project wants to deliver documentation-wise. Is there possibly a [KISS][] all-encompassing way to satisfactorily address all stakeholders? Maybe ...

LSC [^LSC] might be a good concept to implement. It is flexible enough to mimic — literally to the dot — the strict way as well as to accommodate a very informal and / or minimalistic writing style.

## The Concept

Food for thought :

> Let us change our traditional attitude to the construction of programs: Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to human beings what we want a computer to do. — Donald E. Knuth [^Donald E. Knuth]

LSC is a spin-off of [Literate Programming][LP] in that respect that it embraces the weave ( documentation ) part of that approach and leaves the tangle ( programming ) aspect to be implemented by the project wanting to use the concept.

Taking the idea of using [Markdown][] for writing documentation — and ease of publishing — to a new level [^inspiration], LCS can be applied to any chosen programming language :

- Documentation starts at the beginning of a line.
- Code is indented ( at least and per additional level ) with exact 4 spaces and spaces only. [^spaces]

That's it — apart from the implementation for extracting the source code.

## Implementations

List of contributions :

- Stefano F. Rausch :

    1. A simple [Grunt][] [File](implementations/stefano-rausch/Gruntfile.js.md) and the accompanying ( essential ) [package.json](implementations/stefano-rausch/package.json.md) file.
    2. The [Editorial][] [Workflow][LSC Editorial Workflow]!

Pull requests are more than welcome. Every contributor is attributed for and retains the copyright of the implementation PR [^PR] published.

Happy literate source coding!
