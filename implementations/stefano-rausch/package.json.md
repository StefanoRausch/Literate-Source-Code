# package

The `package.json` file belongs in the root directory of your project, next to the `Gruntfile` — see <http://gruntjs.com/getting-started>, and should be committed with your project source. It stores metadata for projects published as [npm][] modules. Running `npm install` in the same folder will install the correct version of each [dependency][] listed therein.

> Barebone configuration.

> see : [Literate Source Code][] — [Gruntfile.coffee][] and [Gruntfile.js][]
